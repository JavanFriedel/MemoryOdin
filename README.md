# Ricky and Morty Survalence Identification Training

- "What is my purpose?"
- You identify faces on survalence footage, because the the original AI we used became too sentient and fell in love with our targets.
- To avoid similiar issues, you will be trained to identify unqique faces only, and should never identify the same person twice in a row.
- As an added bonus, if you get a high enough score, you will be permitted one sick day.
- Goodluck cadet, and don't think too much, your literally hired you not to be sentient.

Game Rules

- You depending on difficulty you will be given a different amount of people to identify and a greater time penalty to your score for taking too long.
- You will start with a bounty on each target of 2000, and it will go down by a set amount after a x amount of grace period.
- Cards of the characters will show up in random orders between 5 options, but will pull from a larger amount (maybe 20?)
